# predicting-housing-prices

01 (5 points) Briefly explain why being able to predict whether my model underpredicted a house's price means that your model "beats" my model.

02 (30 points) Use two different models to predict undervalued.

One of the models should be an ensemble of trees.

The other model should be a non-tree method (and cannot be OLS regression or linear-regression elasticnet).

Use cross validation to tune each of the models' hyperparametersâ€”with accuracy as the metric.

You should write recipes that clean and prep your data for each model too.

03 (5 points) How did you do? Compare your models' levels of accuracy to the null classier.

04 (5 points) Are all errors equal in this setting? Briefly explain your answer.

05 (5 points) Why would it be a bad idea to use a linear model here (for example plain OLS or lasso)?

Hint: Think about how undervalued was created.
